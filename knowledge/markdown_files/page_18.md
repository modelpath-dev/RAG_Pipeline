## Which is the right hybrid car for me?

Using a [hybrid car](https://www.mg.co.uk/electric-and-hybrid/hybrid-cars "Hybrid Cars") can be your first step into the world of [electric cars](https://www.mg.co.uk/electric-and-hybrid/electric-cars "Electric Cars") and help you to have a positive impact on the economy. Potentially saving you lots of money in fuel, hybrid cars are the best way to ensure that you are doing your part in helping to move towards a greener planet, whilst also handling a smooth and reliable drive.

Hybrid cars are cars that run on both electric energy as well as petrol and diesel. In combining both methods, you are able to enjoy the comfort of knowing that you are supported on long drives, but also helping the environment by running on electric for short journeys.

There are three types of hybrid car on the market; plug-in hybrids, self charging hybrids, and mild hybrids. Before investing, it is worth exploring what differentiates them and which hybrid car works for your lifestyle.

## What is a plug-in hybrid?

A plug-in hybrid vehicle, otherwise known as PHEV is a great option for those who are not ready to go completely electric as they provide the fuel and emissions benefits of an electric car on short drives, but also have the back-up of a petrol engine for longer runs.

A PHEV is essentially a hybrid car with a battery pack that can be plugged in to charge it up. They are typically able to run 20 to 30 miles only on electrical energy. Once the electric energy has been depleted, your plug-in hybrid will automatically switch to your petrol engine so you can carry on your drive with no hesitation.

## How do I charge a plug-in hybrid?

A PHEV can be charged either with a conventional three pin plug, a wall charger or a public charging point. It is also possible to install a home charging point to make it easier to charge your hybrid at home. As using a three-pin plug can be the slowest method of charging your car, it is best to install a home charging point that can be kept on an exterior wall or in a garage. Once this has been installed, using your hybrid car will save you money in the long run, as you will not be as reliant on more expensive energy sources such as petrol and diesel.

## Points to consider when buying a plug-in hybrid

Although regular hybrids tend to be more expensive than petrol-powered equivalents, plug-in hybrids are even more so. The reason for this is due to the advanced battery that a plug-in hybrid holds. As there is also extra equipment involved, including home charging points, the initial investment can be slightly higher than it would be for a petrol powered car.

## Our MG plug-in hybrid range

Our [MG HS Plug-in Hybrid](https://www.mg.co.uk/new-cars/old-mg-hs-plug-in-hybrid "MG HS Plug-in Hybrid") is our first ever [hybrid car](https://www.mg.co.uk/electric-and-hybrid/hybrid-cars "Hybrid Cars"). With an electric range of 32 miles with zero tailpipe emissions, this is plenty for most commutes.

Our MG HS Plug-in Hybrid interiors have prioritised comfort and quality to make it a quality space for any ride. With spacious leather seating and our MG Pilot safety system that helps to keep you and other drivers on the road protected, our MG HS Plug-in Hybrid range offers a brilliant ride.

## What is a self charging hybrid?

A self charging hybrid is a car that can drive using electric power alone. Unlike a PHEV, it cannot be plugged in to charge, rather, it charges itself by using the on-board petrol engine.

Most hybrid cars feature a petrol engine, an electric motor and a small battery pack. As you drive a self charging hybrid, the power from the engine and the kinetic energy retrieved from slowing down and braking is used to charge the battery pack, leading to the term ‘self charging’. As you accelerate, the electricity from the batteries powers the electric motor and helps the car gain speed.

## Points to consider when buying a self-charging hybrid

Self charging hybrids are better in stop-start driving, which is better for driving in the city or town, rather than driving at constant speed on the motorway. The opportunities for energy recovery are reduced. This means that you will only be able to travel a mile or so on battery alone, before the engine has to kick-in and top-up the battery.

Experience the drive of a hybrid, enjoying the advantages of zero emissions, whilst having the comfortable drive of a petrol car. With our incredible technology and smooth performance, have a look at our MG [Hybrid range](https://www.mg.co.uk/electric-and-hybrid/hybrid-cars "Hybrid Cars") for more information.

## What is a mild hybrid?

Mild hybrids are another way in which electric components are fitted to petrol and diesel-powered vehicles to reduce their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The key difference, however, is that their electric component is not powerful enough to allow the car to run on just electric power. Typically, a small generator is installed in place of the starter motor and alternator, powering components that would have previously run off the engine, increasing fuel efficiency.

## How do mild hybrids reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions?

It can vary between manufacturers, but mild hybrids usually use power from the electric generator to help the engine during fuel-draining tasks, such as hard acceleration and restarting the engine. In addition, energy is harvested during braking and then captured in the electric battery to provide extra support when needed.

## Points to consider when buying a mild hybrid

Due to having a less complex electrical component than other hybrid variations, mild hybrids typically come with a reduced up-front cost. In addition, they don’t require charging, meaning they can be slightly easier to adjust to when moving from a traditional engine car and mean you won’t have to install a charging point.

These greater similarities with petrol and diesel cars also mean that mild hybrids aren’t as environmentally beneficial when compared to self-charging or plug-in hybrids. In addition, they also don’t qualify for the lowest rate of company car tax.
