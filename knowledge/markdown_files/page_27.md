## How to charge an electric car

[Electric car](https://www.mg.co.uk/electric-and-hybrid/electric-cars "Electric Cars") charging is different from filling up a petrol or diesel car. You can plug your car into a regular socket, however, this greatly extends the charging time. The ideal way to charge is through a [charging station](https://www.mg.co.uk/blog/ev-charging-point-installation-guide "EV Charging Point Installation Guide") with special equipment that can transfer electricity to your vehicle.

Most electric cars have chargers that come with the car, but if you have an older model or you're buying a [used electric car](https://www.mg.co.uk/used-cars), you may need to purchase an adapter or charger separately. You can also charge your electric car at various public charging stations scattered around the country. These can be found in service stations, car parks, or on the streets.

Here’s everything you need to know about the two main ways of charging your electric car:

### **1. Public charging stations**

Public charging points can be easily located through your Sat Nav. There are also lots of useful apps you can use such as ZapMap, which locates the nearest public charging station to you so that you can always find power when your battery is running low. Be sure to have some cash on you, or download one of the apps to pay, just like how you would pay for parking. As electric cars become more popular and technology develops, more charging stations will have contactless payments to make it easier than ever to charge your electric car.

### **2. How to charge an electric car at home**

[Electric car charging at home](https://www.mg.co.uk/blog/how-charge-electric-car-home "How To Charge An Electric Car At Home") is relatively simple - you’re just going to need a long extension cable! You can charge your car from any standard 240v outlet that you have in your home with no trouble. If you don’t have a drive or garage and you’re parking your car on the street, you might choose to put some protective gear over the wire of your extension cable. This ensures that people can walk over it safely without any tripping hazards. It also makes sure your extension cable lasts as long as possible without it being trodden down. _(Note: While possible, using a standard 3-pin socket is generally recommended only occasionally or in emergencies due to slow speed and potential strain on the socket. A dedicated home charger is usually preferred for regular home charging)._
