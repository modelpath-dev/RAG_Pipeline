* **Greater power -** It is much easier to accelerate in an automatic electric car because there is no gear change which makes for a much more seamless driving experience. This allows you to generate power much more easily, so you never have to worry about stalling or holding up traffic.
* **Easier to maintain -** The lack of gear stick, clutch and combustion engine means that automatic cars, and especially EVs, tend to need less mechanical work in the long run. This can help keep repairs and running costs low which can help you save money overtime.
