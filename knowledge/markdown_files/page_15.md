# Can You Recycle Electric Car Batteries?

One of the [benefits of an electric car](https://www.mg.co.uk/electric-life/benefits-electric-cars) is that it is good for the environment. Electric cars produce zero emissions which means they are better for the environment than fuel cars and can help reduce air pollution. However, the materials used to make an electric car still have an environmental impact. Therefore, to ensure [electric cars are as green as possible](https://www.mg.co.uk/electric-life/how-green-are-electric-cars), we have to minimise the impact caused by the manufacturing process which we can do by recycling materials. Although electric car batteries are not something you recycle everyday so there may be confusion about where you can dispose of them. This article will tell you exactly how to recycle electric car batteries and why it’s important to do so.

## Can you recycle electric car batteries?

Yes you can recycle electric car batteries. Most electric cars are made with lithium-ion batteries which can be easily recycled, as long as they are handled with care. It’s imperative that a professional disposes of the batteries because they contain toxins which can be harmful if not handled in the correct way.

To dispose of electric car batteries you first have to find a local place that recycles them. You simply need to phone your local council or do some research online to see where your nearest recycling centre is. You should also check if the centre has any specific requirements such as draining the battery first, or if they will accept fully charged batteries.

## How to find EV battery recycling centres

The first thing to do is contact your local council, car manufacturer, waste management centre or a company who specialises in recycling electric car batteries. Just like normal hazardous waste you cannot dispose of your batteries in any old recycling centre, it must go through the proper channels.

If you live in cities like London or Birmingham that champion green initiatives then there may be a few places to dispose of your batteries for free. If you live in a more remote area then you may need to pay a collection service to pick your battery up from your doorstep.

Once recycling electric car batteries becomes more common, we should see more recycling centres appear as demand increases, with companies like [Veolia already opening the first electric vehicle battery recycling plant in the UK.](https://www.veolia.co.uk/press-releases/veolia-announces-its-first-electric-vehicle-battery-recycling-plant-uk)

## Why is it important to recycle electric car batteries

1.  **Recycling prevents batteries from ending up in landfill -** If you simply throw your car battery away or bury it in the ground it will just end up in landfill where the chemicals will seep into the earth which can damage the environment.
2.  **You can reuse valuable materials -** Lithium-ion batteries can be made with metals like cobalt, nickel and lead, which can be extracted and used to make other objects when car batteries are recycled.
3.  **To protect the environment and surrounding wildlife -** The chemicals within the battery can be harmful to the planet and its wildlife if it enters landfill or the water supply. Therefore, it's imperative to dispose of these chemicals properly to help protect the planet for us humans and animals alike.
4.  **It reduces the cost of making an electric car -** The battery is one of the most expensive components of an electric car. Reusing the materials from an old electric battery can help keep these costs down because manufacturers do not need to mine for the raw materials. This also helps to reduce the amount of resources we are taking from the earth which can be more sustainable.
5.  **The energy from electric car batteries can be reused -** Electric cars can store energy which can be diverted to other sources once it no longer needs to power a vehicle. Some examples include giving the energy back to the national grid, which is not only more energy efficient, but helps to create a closed-looped system of recycling.

For more information on recycling electric car batteries contact your local council or car manufacturer to gain advice on how you can dispose of your car battery safely.
