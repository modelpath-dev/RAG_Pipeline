## Android Auto Setup on your MG

To run Android Auto on your MG, your Android phone must be running Android 6.0 or higher and have an active data plan.

For some models of Android phone, you will need to download and install the latest Android Auto app from the Play Store. You will also require a good quality USB cable to connect your device to the vehicle.

1.  Ensure the vehicle is stationary with the park brake applied. Make sure you have Park or Neutral selected.
2.  Connect the USB cable to the data USB connection of your vehicle. The data USB connection is located in the front centre console and can be identified by the Phone/Tablet icon that is shown next to it.
3.  Once a successful USB connection has been made a message will be displayed on the infotainment screen.
4.  The initial setup process for Android Auto must be completed on the phone. The prompts on the phone can be followed to read the safety information, accept the privacy policy, and grant any permissions that Android Auto requires.
    * Note: The setup screen on the phone may be slightly different depending on the software version.
5.  Once the phone setup is complete the Android Auto interface will be shown on the Infotainment screen.
6.  If the Android Auto interface does not automatically show it may be necessary to press the highlighted Android Auto button on the Infotainment home screen.
7.  Congratulations! Android Auto setup is complete. You won't have to follow these steps again to connect your device, simply connect to the USB port and Android Auto will be ready to use.
    * Note: Android Auto will only display apps that are Android Auto compatible. It will not show all of the apps available on your phone.

### Common Android Auto Features
