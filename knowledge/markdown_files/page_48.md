## What is a car service?

A car service is a health check of your car. It’s an opportunity to check that everything is in working order and nothing needs fixing.

Regular check ups can help you to keep your car in a good condition, which ensures it is safe to drive and not depreciating too fast in value. Some drivers even book a car service before their MOT to test whether their vehicle will pass or not.

A full car service will take no longer than a day. In fact, it normally takes between 1 - 4 hours depending on the garage and condition of your vehicle. Therefore, you do not have to worry about being without a car for too long. Simply drop it off at the garage, go away for a couple of hours, and come back to pick it up again. You’ll have peace of mind that your car is safe to drive all in a day’s work.
